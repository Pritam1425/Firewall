## How does Firewall help to secure pc?
Firstly to know about how the firewall works, we should know about what is firewall.

### What is firewall?
```
A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets based on a
set of security rules. Its purpose is to establish a barrier between your internal network and incoming traffic from external sources (such
as the internet) in order to block malicious traffic like viruses and hackers.
```
Basically, firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic on a predefined security
rules and establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network.

Firewalls carefully analyze incoming traffic based on pre-established rules and filter traffic coming from unsecured or suspicious sources
to prevent attacks. Firewalls guard traffic at a computer’s entry point, called ports, which is where information is exchanged with 
external devices. For example, “Source address 172.18.1.1 is allowed to reach destination 172.18.2.1 over port 22."

### For example:
Let us think of IP addresses as houses and ports as room no within the house. Only trusted people (source addresses) are allowed to enter 
the house (destination address) at all—then it’s further filtered so that people within the house are only allowed to access certain rooms 
(destination ports), depending on if they're the owner, a child, or a guest. The owner is allowed to any room (any port), while children 
and guests are allowed into a certain set of rooms (specific ports). And all of this is done by firewall.

So firewall plays a vital role in securing our system from harmful outside network. It creates a wall between inside and outside network and monitors each data packet if it is harmful or not.
